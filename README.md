### Goal

This applicaction is an extension for VLC created with the purpose of agilizing the language learning. The idea is to a build a tool that controls subtitles corresponding to the video being played by VLC. Take into account that this is meant for japanese learning.

I'am looking for:

* integation with an online dictionary through an API
* navigation between words that compounds the current caption
* flashcards creation for saving words and sentences as examples (for adding context to the word being studied)
* ciclic playing of phrases (or something like that)

### API
The is to text different alternatives for example:
* kanjiapi (https://kanjiapi.dev/) **(proven, working)**
* JLPT Vocabulary API
* Jisho
